Instruction Manual: Plagiarism Checker, AI Detection & Paraphraser

This manual provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up, install, and run the Plagiarism Checker, AI Detection, and Plagiarism Remover system.

1. System Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

Python Version: 3.9 or later

MongoDB: Installed and running locally (mongodb://localhost:27017/)

GPU (Optional): For faster AI processing (Recommended: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support)



---

2. Installation Guide

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plagiarism-ai-detector.git
cd plagiarism-ai-detector


---

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows


---

Step 3: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs all required Python libraries.


---

Step 4: Start MongoDB

Ensure MongoDB is running locally before starting the application.

For Windows: Open Command Prompt and run:

mongod

For Linux/macOS: Run:

sudo systemctl start mongod



---

Step 5: Configure MongoDB Connection (Optional)

If MongoDB is running on a different host, update config.py:

MONGO_URI = "mongodb://your-mongodb-server-ip:27017/"


---

3. Running the Application

Start the GUI (Main Interface)

Run the following command in the project directory:

python plagremover/master.py

This will launch the Tkinter-based GUI where you can perform plagiarism checks, AI detection, and plagiarism removal.


---

Using Individual Components (Command Line Execution)

If you want to run the features separately:

1. Plagiarism Checker

python plagremover/plagiarism_checker.py

Fetches the latest document from MongoDB

Compares it with stored web results

Generates a plagiarism report


2. AI-Generated Content Detector

python plagremover/ai_checker.py

Detects AI-generated or paraphrased content

Stores results in MongoDB under aigenrel


3. Plagiarism Remover (Paraphraser)

python plagremover/plagiarism_remover.py

Rewrites plagiarized content

Uses an LLM model (mistral) for paraphrasing

5. Additional Notes

Updating Dependencies

If new features are added, update dependencies:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

Troubleshooting

If MongoDB connection fails, check that MongoDB is running.

If CUDA errors occur, ensure you have the correct NVIDIA drivers installed.

If Tkinter GUI doesnâ€™t launch, ensure your Python installation includes Tkinter.
